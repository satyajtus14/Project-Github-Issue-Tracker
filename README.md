## 🚀 Quick Start

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satyajtus14/Milestone-05-Github-Issue-Tracker.git
    cd Milestone-05-Github-Issue-Tracker
    ```

2.  **Open the application**
    This is a static HTML/CSS/JS application, so no server setup is strictly required to view it.
    -   Simply open `index.html` or `home.html` directly in your web browser.
        `file:///path/to/Milestone-05-Github-Issue-Tracker/home.html`
    -   For a better development experience with live reloading, you can use a local web server like the "Live Server" extension for VS Code.

### Start development server
If using a local server (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension):
1.  Right-click on `home.html` (or `index.html`) in your editor.
2.  Select "Open with Live Server" (or equivalent option for your local server).

### Open your browser
The application will open in your default browser at a URL like `http://localhost:5500/home.html` (port may vary).

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Milestone-05-Github-Issue-Tracker/
├── assets/                  # Directory for images, fonts, and other static assets
├── scripts/                 # Contains JavaScript files for application logic
├── home.html                # The main application page for issue tracking
├── index.html               # Initial landing page or login placeholder
├── style.css                # Custom CSS styles
├── tailwind.css             # Tailwind CSS output/base styles
├── tailwind.config.js       # Configuration file for Tailwind CSS
└── README_OLD.md            # Previous README documentation
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
The `tailwind.config.js` file allows you to customize your Tailwind CSS setup, including themes, plugins, and content paths.

```JavaScript
// tailwind.config.js (Example, actual content may vary)
module.exports = {
  content: ["./*.html", "./scripts/*.js"], // Paths to your HTML and JS files
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
  daisyui: {
    themes: ["light"], // Or customize with different themes
  },
};
```
If you make changes to `tailwind.config.js` or directly edit `tailwind.css`, you might need to rebuild Tailwind CSS depending on your setup. As this project is purely static, it's assumed `tailwind.css` is pre-generated or linked via CDN. For advanced customization, you would typically use a build tool like `npm` and `PostCSS`.

## 🔧 Development

Development for this project involves editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly. There are no specific build scripts configured within the repository (e.g., in a `package.json`).

### Available Scripts
N/A - This project does not use a package manager with defined scripts.

### Development Workflow
1.  Make changes to HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.
2.  Refresh your browser (or rely on Live Server for auto-reloads) to see updates.
3.  For Tailwind CSS modifications, you might need to manually compile Tailwind if you're not using a CDN, or integrate a simple build process (e.g., via a `package.json` with `tailwindcss` as a dev dependency) if you wish to customize beyond what's pre-built.

## 🧪 Testing

This project does not include an explicit testing framework setup. Functionality can be manually tested by interacting with the application in a web browser.

## 🚀 Deployment

Since this is a static web application, deployment is straightforward:

### Production Build
There is no specific "build" step for production beyond ensuring all files are present. The `home.html`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `tailwind.css`, `scripts/` directory, and `assets/` directory are the core deployable assets.

### Deployment Options
-   **GitHub Pages**: The simplest way to deploy this project is via GitHub Pages. Push your code to the `main` branch, and configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `main` branch. The demo link above assumes this deployment method.
-   **Any Static Host**: Upload the entire repository content (excluding `.git` and `.DS_Store`) to any static web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, Apache/Nginx web server).
